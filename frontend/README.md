## Usage Walkthrough

The Login Page allows the usage of a `Demo User`, feel free to login with a click of that button.

You may also `Sign Up` and `Login` with your own credentials if you so choose.

The Profile Page allows you to customize your user Profile with an image and a biography, as well as see how many followers you have and how many you are following.

You can edit your profile with the `Edit Profile` button which makes editable text ***accessable with a double click***. Save your changes with the save button.

New Stories can be make by selecting the New Story button which will take you to a New Story Form.

The New Story Form takes a Title, Byline, and Body Text of your Story. Click `Publish` to share your story with the world! This will take you to the `Stories` Page where you will find your Story among others.

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

From here you can ***click anywhere*** on a Story; *image, Title, Byline, or Author*. This will take you to `view that particular Story`.

While viewing an individual story. You can `Follow` a User/Author and if you really like what they have to say, even Applaud their Story with the `Clap` button!.

Every Story has `Comments` where you can share your thoughts on a story. And read what other users have had to say.
